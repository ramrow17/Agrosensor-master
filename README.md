# Agrosensor-master
This project was for my Senior Design Project - Agrosensor. Our team designed a system to monitor plant health for optimal conditions to promote the maximal growth and harvest of specific plants.

I mainly contributed code for the Arduino board that was used to program and prototype the system - primarily to data extraction and networking code on the board. I also assisted in creating scripts to be able to pass along information from the board onto the server we used to store our database and provide the information for the mobile application.
